# Chess - CSC1060 Final Project
## Description
This is a rough implementation of Chess in C++. It has two capabilities: Playing a game of chess and showing a replay of a game. If you choose to play a game, the program takes input from the user and if you choose to look at a replay of a game, the program takes input from an external file.
### Missing features
- The program is unable to handle en passants and pawn promotions. (todo)
- The program is unable to display the board in a readable form.
- The replay part of the program is unable to go back and forth between the moves. (todo)
